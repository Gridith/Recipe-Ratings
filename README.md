# Recipe Ratings
A mod created for the modpack Rat's Enrichment with a hyperspecific goal of informing players a little more about their recipes, by adding configurable icons to EMI that can indicate something about the recipe it's attached to.

In Rat's Enrichment the icons are used to indicate how fair or balanced a specific recipe is on an established scale.
